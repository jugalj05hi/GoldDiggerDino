        <h2> Gameplay </h2>
    </div>
    <p>
        The goal of the game is to collect as many coins as you can and reach the red flag! However, you must do this
        while avoiding enemy characters. If you get hit by an enemy you will lose one life. Be careful you only have 3
        lives! To move your character you can use WASD or the arrow keys, with w, up, and space bar being used to jump.
        To move forward while you jump hit the left/right arrow or A/D as you press spacebar. You can also kill an enemy
        character by jumping on top of it, however we do not condone violence.

        <h2> Special Feautre </h2>
    </div>
    <p>
        The special feature in our game is parallax! Parallax is a scrolling technique in which the background image
        moves slowly in comparision to the foreground images. This creates an illusion of depth in a 2D
        scene.

        The following docs below are generated through ‘Doxygen’ and gives you an overview of the game code base and
        architecture of the Game Engine. <a href="./docs/html/index.html"> Architecture Docs </a>

        <h2> Post Mortem </h2>
    </div>
    <p>Making this game has been a learning process for everyone, if we had more time we could have done a lot more.
    </p>
    <p>One of our biggest struggles was refactoring the code to use the Component Pattern. We underestimated how long
        and tedious it would be, and that delayed the process of everything else that needed to be done, which left us
        short on time. If we could we would have liked to spend more time fine tuning the physics component. We also
        could have made child classes from game entity like main player, NPCs, collectable item, just to have more
        separation of data types because at the moment we have game entity containing a lot of attributes that may not
        be neccessary for all game entities.
    </p>
    <p> Besides that it would have been nice if we could have implemented more features. For example having a 2 player
        option or making the character experience different effects from consuming different items like being able to
        temporarily fly after consuming a feather or moving faster after consuming a potion. Another fun idea would have
        been adding a character creator portion of the game where the user can choose different outfits or
        colors for the dino.</p>

        <h2> Project Files & Binaries </h2>
    </div>
    <p>The following libraries are needed in order to run the game: SDL2, SDL_Mixer, SDL_ttf, and SDL_image.</p>
    <p>Run the following in order to build the executable <code> python build.py </code>. After you can run the
        following to play the game <code> ./bin/game </code> .</p>
